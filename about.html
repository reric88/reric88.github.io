        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to my website portfolio! My name is Eric Collard, and I am
          thrilled to have this opportunity to share my passion for markup, coding, and anything else with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack web and app developer with many years of experience in coding structures. Throughout my time learning, I have had the
          privilege of working on many projects and collaborating with
          talented individuals who have helped shape my skills and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in development began early in my life, but only recently have I decided to pursue a career using these skills. Since the beginning, I have been dedicated to expanding my skill set
          and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and
          technological advancements. I believe in the power of continuous
          learning and strive to enhance my expertise through various courses,
          workshops, bootcamps, and self-directed study.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach to development is often unconventional, driven by my creativity and the need to find solutions. I am passionate about finding new ways to complete my tasks. Whether
          it's creating, styling and coding websites, games or applications, I am constantly motivated to deliver exceptional results and
          exceed expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional endeavors, I am an avid tinkerer, woodworker and gamer. These activities
          not only bring me joy but also inspire creativity and fresh
          perspectives in my work. I am also a father and husband, and I strongly believe that a well-rounded life
          enriches both personal and professional experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this website, you will find a collection of my finest projects and
          achievements, showcasing my expertise and the value I can bring to
          your team or organization. I invite you to explore my portfolio and
          get a glimpse of the projects I have created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to
          connecting with you and discussing potential collaborations, ideas, or
          opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me via the provided contact
          information, and let's embark on a journey of innovation together.
